# mep_scraping
This python code allows to extract details on Members of the European Parliament from the website of the European Parliament (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/full-list/a).  It creates a pandas data frame including MEPs' name, political party group, date of birth, place of birth, and committee roles. The script then exports this data in a csv format.
